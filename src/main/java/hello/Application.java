/*
Although it is possible to package this service as a traditional WAR file for deployment to an external
application server, the simpler approach demonstrated below creates a standalone application.
You package everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old Java main() method.
Along the way, you use Springâ€™s support for embedding the Tomcat servlet container as the HTTP runtime,
instead of deploying to an external instance.
